# Contrite Heart
There are moments in life when words feel insufficient to express the depth of oneâ€™s feelings, and yet, we find ourselves compelled to share them. This is one of those moments - an attempt to speak what has long been silent in my heart. What follows is not a plea, nor a declaration, but a simple reflection of what once was, and a quiet tribute to you.


This poem is simply a heartfelt gesture, a desire to convey my gratitude for the moments we shared. You were once a part of my life, and I cherish the time we spent together. These words carry no expectations or claims, only recognition and respect for the days we lived. May every laugh of yours, every fleeting moment, remain a bright memory along the journey we once walked, and may this poem serve as a reminder that I will never forget how significant you were in the story of my life.


I simply wish for you to read this. Without response, without comment, if you do not want to say anything. I do not seek anything from you, nor expect anything in return. I only want you to know. Perhaps you will understand, perhaps you will not, but this is my truth - unspoken, yet deeply felt. This is my final offering of words to you, and I will not intrude upon your life again, unless you, by some chance, wish for our paths to meet once more.
