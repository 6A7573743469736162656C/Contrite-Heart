# Contrite Heart
There are times in our lives when words feel inadequate to express our feelings and emotions, however, we are given no option but to bring them forth. This is one of those moments - an attempt to voice what has been silent in my heart for a long time. What follows is neither a plea nor a declaration, but a simple reflection of what once was, and a quiet tribute to you.


I want to loudly and fully express my appreciation for the fond memories and the good times we shared together, this poem is just a heartfelt gesture. I cherish the times when you were in my life because I felt true felicity with you.


These words carry no expectations or demands, only recognition and respect for the days we lived. May every laugh of yours, every fleeting moment, remain a bright memory along the journey we once walked, and may this poem serve as a reminder that I will never forget how significant you were in the story of my life.


I simply wish for you to read this, without response, without any comment, unless you feel inclined to say something. I do not seek anything from you, nor expect anything in return. I only want you to know. Perhaps you will understand, perhaps you will not, but this is my truth - unspoken, yet deeply felt. 


This is my final offering of words to you, and I will not intrude upon your life again, unless, by some chance, you wish for our paths to cross once more.
